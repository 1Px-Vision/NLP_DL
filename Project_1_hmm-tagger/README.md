# Project Hidden Markov Model Tagger: HMM-tagger

Using a universal tagset, We will use the Pomegranate library to construct a hidden Markov model for part-of-speech tagging. Hidden Markov models have demonstrated the ability to achieve over 96% tagging accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Beyond part-of-speech tagging, these models have been successfully applied in various domains, including speech recognition and generation, machine translation, gene recognition in bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition in computer vision, among others.
