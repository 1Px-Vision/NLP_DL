# Project: Machine Translation
In this notebook, any section with a header ending in '(IMPLEMENTATION)' says that the following code blocks will need additional functional, which you are responsible for providing. Please read the instructions thoroughly!

### Introduction
In this notebook, you will develop a deep neural network that forms a key component of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. This pipeline will input English text and output its French translation.

### Preprocessing
You will start by converting the text into a sequence of integers.

### Model Creation
You will build models that take these sequences of integers as input and produce a probability distribution over potential translations. After learning about the basic neural network architectures commonly used in machine translation, you can design your own model.

### Prediction
Finally, you will run the model on English text to generate translations.
